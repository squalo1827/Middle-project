			<h3>Maiar</h3>
			<p>The Maiar are lesser Ainur who entered Ea in the beginning of time. The name Maiar is in the Quenya tongue and comes from the Elvish root maya- "excellent, admirable".Being of divine origin and possessing great power, the Maiar can wander the world unseen or shape themselves in fashion of Elves or other creatures; these "veils", called fanar in Quenya, could be destroyed, but their true-being could not. Rarely did the Maiar adopt their visible forms to elves and man, and for that reason, very few of the Maiar have names in their tongues, and the elves do not know how many of the Maiar exist.<br>Melkor (known in Sindarin as Morgoth), the evil Vala, corrupted many Maiar into his service. These included Sauron and the Balrogs, his demons of flame and shadow.These are called in Quenya Umaiar.In about T.A. 1100, the Valar sent several Maiar to Middle-earth to help contest the evil of Sauron. They had great skills of hand and mind but were cloaked in the guise of men, seemingly old but of great vigour.Their mission was to guide elves and men by gaining trust and spreading knowledge, not by ruling them with fear and force. They were known as the Istari, or Wizards, and included Gandalf the Grey (Olorin or Mithrandir; later Gandalf the White), Saruman the White (Curumo or Curunir; he later called himself Saruman of Many Colours), Radagast the Brown (Aiwendil), and two Blue Wizards.</p>
