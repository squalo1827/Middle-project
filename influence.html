			<h3>Influence</h3>
			<p>The Lord of the Rings developed as a personal exploration by Tolkien of his interests in philology, religion (particularly Roman Catholicism), fairy tales, Norse and general Germanic mythology, and also Celtic,[better source needed] Slavic, Persian, Greek, and Finnish mythology. Tolkien acknowledged, and external critics have verified, the influences of George MacDonald and William Morris and the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf.The question of a direct influence of Wagner's The Nibelung's Ring on Tolkien's work is debated by critics.</p>
