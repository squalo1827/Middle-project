			<h3>Sauron</h3>
			<p>race:Maiar<br>	the reorganizing and rehabilitation of Middle-earth, 'neglected by the gods,' Sauron  becomes a reincarnation of Evil, and a thing lusting for Complete Power", eventually rising to become "master and god of Men".<br>Gandalf deduced that the ring that Bilbo had found in Gollum's cave was indeed Sauron's lost Master-ring. He informed Frodo about the true nature of the heirloom Bilbo had left for him, and its terrible potential if Sauron should ever regain it: "The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring... So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it."Gandalf went for advice to Saruman, but discovered that he had been corrupted by his long studies of Sauron. Using the palantir in the tower of Orthanc, Saruman was now in communication with the Dark Lord and acted as his ally, though he also secretly hoped to take the Ring for himself and use its power to supplant Sauron. In The Fellowship of the Ring they were armed with steel swords, while the Witch-king wielded a Morgul blade that could turn its victim into a wraith. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Witch-king bore a "long pale sword", and later used a mace against Eowyn.</p>
