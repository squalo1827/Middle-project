Hobbits are a diminutive, humanoid race who inhabit the lands of Middle-earth. They are also referred to as Halflings.

Hobbits are not quite as stocky as the similarly-sized dwarves, but still tend to be stout, with slightly pointed ears. Hobbits are between two and four feet tall, the average height being three feet six inches. They dress in bright colours, favouring yellow and green. Nowadays, they are usually shy, but are nevertheless capable of great courage and amazing feats under the proper circumstances. They are adept with slings and throwing stones. For the most part, they cannot grow beards, but a few of the race of Stoor can. Their feet are covered with curly hair with leathery soles, so most hobbits hardly ever wear shoes. The race's average life expectancy is 100 years. 

Hobbits as fond of an unadventurous, bucolic and simple life of farming, eating, and socializing, although capable of defending their homes courageously if the need arises. They would enjoy six meals a day, if they could get them.The hobbits of the Shire developed the custom of giving away gifts on their birthdays, instead of receiving them, although this custom was not universally followed among other hobbit cultures or communities.Some Hobbits live in "hobbit-holes" or Smials, traditional underground homes found in hillsides, downs, and banks.Like all Hobbit architecture, the hobbit holes are notable for their round doors and windows.
