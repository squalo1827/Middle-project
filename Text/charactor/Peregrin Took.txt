race: Hobbit
Peregrin was the only son and heir of Paladin Took II, the Thain of the Shire. His best friend Meriadoc Brandybuck, more commonly known as Merry, was his cousin; another good friend was Frodo Baggins.
'Peregrin' means 'traveller in strange countries'. Pippin indeed saw much more of Middle-earth than most Hobbits: he journeyed with Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring, and fought in the War of the Ring. Late in life he travelled again to the kingdoms of Rohan and Gondor.
