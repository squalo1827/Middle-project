The Dwarves are a race inhabiting Middle-earth. They are based on the dwarfs of Germanic myths: small humanoids that dwell in mountains, and are associated with mining, metal-craft and jewelry.

 the Dwarves are described as shorter and stockier than Elves and Men, able to withstand both heat and cold. Though they are mortal, Dwarves have an average lifespan of 250 years.They breed slowly, for no more than a third of them are female, and not all marry; also, female Dwarves look and sound (and dress, if journeying¡Xwhich is rare) so alike to Dwarf-males that other folk cannot distinguish them, and thus others wrongly believe Dwarves grow out of stone.Dwarves are great metalworkers, smiths and stoneworkers. Fierce in battle, their main weapons are axes, but they also use bows, swords, shields and mattocks.
Since they lived underground, Dwarves did not grow their own food supplies if they could help it, and usually obtained food through trade with Elves and Men. Dwarf and human communities often formed trade relations where the Men were the prime suppliers of food, farmers and herdsmen, while the Dwarves supplied tools and weapons, road-building and construction work.

Unlike Elves and Men, created by the supreme god Iluvatar, Dwarves were created by the Vala Aule.
