The Lord of the Rings is set in Middle-earth, a fictional world created by Tolkien. Mystical creatures such as hobbits, orcs, trolls, ents, elves, wangs, wizards, dragons, dwarves and men inhabit middle-earth. Middle-earth is a magical world in which imagination rules, but it exists very much like "real" society, with political and economic problems and power struggles. Each of the races that inhabit this world have their own territories and are distinct from one another.

Part I is set in the Shire, a community of mostly hobbits. Bag End is in the Shire and is the home of Frodo, the hero. At the end of Part I, a group of travelling adventurers including Frodo leaves for Rivendell, an elf refuge. Part II takes place beyond the Shire in the rough worlds between Bag End and the citadel of Sarumon, the tower Orthanc at Isengard. It also takes place in the Tower of Sorcery, Minas Morgul, where the evil Sauron rules. Part III takes place in Mordor, a mountain range containing the volcano Orodruin. It also takes place on the road between Mordor and Bag End. The novel concludes just where it began, at Bag End.
