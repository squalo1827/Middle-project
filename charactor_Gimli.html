			<h3>Gimli</h3>
			<p>race: Dwarf<br>Gimli was a remote descendant of Durin the Deathless, chief of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves and ancestor to the Dwarven people to which Gimli belonged, the Longbeards. Gimli was introduced at the Council of Elrond Half-elven. Gimli and his father were attending the Council to bring news of their home, Erebor, and to warn that the Dark Lord Sauron was searching for the One Ring.  Frodo volunteered for the task, and Elrond chose eight people of varying races to aid him in his task â€” including Gimli. Within the Fellowship there was initially friction between Gimli and the elf Legolas, for various reasons: more recently Thranduil, Legolas' father, once imprisoned Gimli's father Gloin.</p>
